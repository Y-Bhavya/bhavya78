<pre style="font-style:oblique";"color:grey";>(these days the life has become a race the person who won the race is an ultimate winner
and the person who lost is a looser,and everyone set a tag person that he is a ultimate looser .Due to the fear of loosing ,and due to the fear of the self respect(fake)
parents are setting the high goals on the children ,infact they are deciding what a child is going to be before their name(funny...).
                      PLANTS ...the first thing that comes in the mind while we are listening to the word is,watering them and providing sunlight.
And here the question arises .....that water and sunlight are really important element for the growth of the every plant(think),Unfortunately "NO".
                              In the same way chidren must be taken care in a special way,evrey child has their own talent     
Story is reeled around the 9yrs old boy named ISHAAN AVASTHI and his teacher RAM SHANKAR NIKUSH .)
