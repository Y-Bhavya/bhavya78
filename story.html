and the person who lost is a looser,and everyone set a tag person that he is a ultimate looser .Due to the fear of loosing ,and due to the fear of the self respect(fake)
parents are setting the high goals on the children ,infact they are deciding what a child is going to be before their name(funny...).
                      PLANTS ...the first thing that comes in the mind while we are listening to the word is,watering them and providing sunlight.
